# g2krepeater

Consumes kafka messages published by g2krelay and sends a POST request to specified endpoint.
The body is guaranteed to be the same as the original webhook event.
The headers are all preserved as well, one additional header is added
`g2krepeater=true`
Make sure to set `REPLAY_ENDPOINT` to the endpoint where the webhooks should be replayed to.
Currently only one endpoint is supported. I do plan to add support for multiple endpoints.
